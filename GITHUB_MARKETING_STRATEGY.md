# 🚀 GITHUB & SOCIAL MEDIA MARKETING STRATEGY

**Project**: PixelProdigy - 3D Studio Production Software  
**Positioning**: "Tools that build tools to build objects"  
**Date**: October 19, 2025  

---

## 🎯 YOUR UNIQUE POSITIONING

### **The Angle**

```
"Meta Horizon Developers use tools to create 3D environments.
I build the TOOLS that BUILD the tools that BUILD objects.

Started: Simple webpage format
Now: Studio production 3D rendering software"
```

**Why this works:**
- ✅ Shows progression (webpage → studio software)
- ✅ Positions you ABOVE tool users (you're a tool creator)
- ✅ Meta-level thinking (tools for tools)
- ✅ Clear differentiation (not just another 3D app)

---

## 📱 TAGGING STRATEGY

### **How Tagging Works on Different Platforms**

#### **GitHub**

```markdown
# In README.md Topics (Repository Settings)
- 3d-rendering
- webgl
- threejs
- meta-quest
- spatial-computing
- game-dev-tools
- procedural-generation
- vr-development
- metaverse-tools
```

**Does NOT notify users**, but:
- ✅ Makes repo discoverable in topic searches
- ✅ GitHub suggests to users interested in those topics
- ✅ Shows in "Related Repositories"

#### **Twitter/X**

```
@MetaHorizon Developers use tools to create 3D environments.

I build the TOOLS that BUILD the tools that BUILD objects 🧰🔧

From simple webpage → full studio production software

#WebGL #ThreeJS #MetaQuest #SpatialComputing

```

**Tagging @MetaHorizon:**
- ✅ They MAY see it (if monitoring mentions)
- ✅ Your followers see it in their feed
- ✅ Appears in @MetaHorizon mention searches
- ⚠️ Don't overdo it (1-2 tags max per post)

#### **LinkedIn**

```
Meta Horizon developers use existing tools.
I build the tools that BUILD those tools. 🛠️

Journey: Webpage format → Full 3D studio production software

Key innovations:
• Multi-layer composition system
• Real-time physics simulation
• GPU-accelerated particle effects
• Interactive object placement
• Professional rendering pipeline

Built with: Three.js, Cannon.js, custom GLSL shaders

Looking to connect with spatial computing developers,
VR/AR engineers, and game development tool creators.

#SpatialComputing #WebGL #VRDevelopment #GameDev #ThreeJS
```

**LinkedIn tagging:**
- Tag companies: `@Meta` `@Unity` `@Epic Games`
- They won't be notified directly
- But appears in company mention feeds
- Good for recruiters searching company tags

#### **Reddit**

**Subreddits to post in:**
- r/webgl
- r/threejs
- r/gamedev
- r/VRDev
- r/Unity3D (tool comparisons)
- r/blender (as alternative workflow)
- r/proceduralgeneration

**Title**:
```
"Built a 3D studio that builds the tools that build objects - 
from webpage to production software in 6 months"
```

---

## 🎯 OPTIMAL TAGGING STRATEGY

### **DO THIS** ✅

1. **Mention competitors/adjacent tools** (positioning):
   ```
   "While Blender users sculpt manually and Unity devs 
   place objects by hand, PixelProdigy generates the 
   tools that automate object creation.
   
   Meta Horizon developers: you use creation tools.
   I build the creation tools themselves."
   ```

2. **Tag COMMUNITIES, not just companies**:
   ```
   #WebGL #ThreeJS #IndieGameDev #SpatialComputing
   #ProceduralGeneration #OpenSource #WebDev
   ```

3. **Tag META-LEVEL concepts**:
   ```
   #ToolsForToolmakers #MetaProgramming #DeveloperTools
   #CreationPipeline #AutomationTools
   ```

4. **Use GitHub Topics** (in repo settings):
   ```
   3d-engine, webgl, threejs, game-development,
   procedural-generation, spatial-computing,
   metaverse, vr-tools, web3d, creative-coding
   ```

### **DON'T DO THIS** ❌

1. ❌ **Don't spam tag @MetaHorizon every post**
   - They'll ignore/block you
   - Looks desperate
   - Use sparingly (1x launch, maybe 1x major update)

2. ❌ **Don't tag without value**:
   ```
   Bad: "@Meta look at my thing!"
   Good: "@Meta Horizon devs might find this workflow 
         interesting - alternative to manual placement"
   ```

3. ❌ **Don't overload hashtags**:
   ```
   Bad: #meta #horizon #vr #ar #xr #3d #webgl #threejs 
        #gamedev #unity #unreal #blender...
   
   Good: #WebGL #ThreeJS #SpatialComputing #GameDev (4-6 max)
   ```

💡 I spent 6 months building the tool that builds tools.

Meta Horizon developers use creation tools.
Game devs use Unity/Unreal.
VR creators use specialized software.

I'm building the layer ABOVE that.

🎯 The Problem:
Manual 3D workflows don't scale. Every object placed by hand.
Every variation modeled individually. Every environment 
hand-crafted.

🔧 The Solution:
PixelProdigy - A tool creation platform. Define rules once,
generate infinite variations. Build tools that build objects.

📊 What I Built:
• Multi-layer composition system
• Real-time physics simulation
• GPU-accelerated effects (10k particles @ 60fps)
• Interactive object manipulation
• Professional rendering pipeline
• All in WebGL (runs in browser)

🚀 From Prototype to Production:
Started with simple HTML/CSS
Now: 6,388 lines of production code
Performance: 60 FPS with 50+ physics objects

Tech Stack: Three.js, Cannon.js, Custom GLSL shaders

🎓 Key Learning:
The best tools enable creativity, not just execution.
Meta-level thinking: build systems that build systems.

Looking to connect with:
• Spatial computing developers
• Game development tool creators
• VR/AR engineers
• WebGL/Three.js community
• Anyone interested in procedural generation

Project is open for collaboration. Reach out if this 
resonates with your work!

## 🎯 TARGETING META HORIZON SPECIFICALLY

### **Strategy 1: Indirect Mention** (Best)

```
Developers working with Meta Horizon, Unity, or Blender 
know the pain of manual object placement.

PixelProdigy takes a different approach: build the tools 
that automate object creation.

Not replacing your workflow. Augmenting it.
```

**Why this works:**
- ✅ Mentions Meta Horizon without tagging
- ✅ Positions as complementary, not competitive
- ✅ Appears in searches for "Meta Horizon tools"
- ✅ Less spammy than direct tags

### **Strategy 2: Value-Add Tag** (Occasional)

```
.@MetaHorizon developers might find this interesting:

Alternative workflow for procedural environment generation.
Instead of placing objects manually, define rules and let
the system generate variations.

Built in WebGL, so it runs anywhere.

[Demo GIF]
```

**When to use:**
- ✅ Launch announcement (1x)
- ✅ Major feature release (sparingly)
- ✅ If you have something genuinely useful for their devs
- ❌ NOT for every update

### **Strategy 3: Community Engagement** (Best ROI)

**Join Meta Developer Forums:**
- Meta Developer Community
- Horizon Worlds Creator Forums
- Meta Quest Developer Slack/Discord

**Provide value first:**
```
"Hey folks, I built a tool that might help with 
procedural environment generation. It's web-based 
so you can test workflows before committing to 
asset creation. Happy to share if useful!"
```

**Result:**
- ✅ Real users trying your tool
- ✅ Genuine feedback
- ✅ Word-of-mouth spread
- ✅ No spam perception

### **2. Blog Post: "From Webpage to Production Software"**

```markdown
## The Journey

6 months ago: HTML button that changed colors
Today: Full 3D studio with physics, particles, and layers

What I learned:
- Start simple, iterate
- Build what you need, not what's trendy
- Meta-level thinking unlocks scale
- WebGL is underrated for production tools

[Your screenshots throughout journey]
```

### **3. Twitter Thread: "Tool-Building Philosophy"**

```
1/ Most developers use tools.
   Some developers build apps.
   Few developers build tools.
   Rare developers build tools that build tools.

2/ Why this matters:
   Users: Consume content
   Devs: Create content
   Tool builders: Enable creation
   Meta-tool builders: Enable enablers

3/ PixelProdigy's approach:
   Don't build objects. Build object generators.
   Don't create environments. Create environment systems.
   Don't place assets. Build placement automation.

## 🎯 FINAL RECOMMENDATIONS

### **DO** ✅

1. **Position as "meta-level" tool creator**
   - You're not competing with Meta Horizon
   - You're building infrastructure they could use

2. **Use GitHub Topics aggressively**
   - 10-15 relevant topics
   - Increases discoverability

3. **Engage in developer communities**
   - r/webgl, r/threejs, r/gamedev
   - Meta Developer Forums
   - Unity/Unreal discords (as alternative)

4. **Create video content**
   - 60-second demos
   - Before/after transformations
   - Live coding sessions

5. **Tag strategically**
   - Communities: Often
   - Companies: Rarely
   - Technologies: Always (#WebGL, #ThreeJS)

### **DON'T** ❌

1. **Don't spam @Meta everywhere**
   - Use in 1 launch post max
   - Otherwise just mention "Meta Horizon devs"

2. **Don't position as competitor**
   - You're complementary, not competitive
   - "For developers using X, Y, Z"

3. **Don't oversell**
   - Show, don't tell
   - Let the demo speak

4. **Don't ignore community**
   - Respond to all comments
   - Help users debug
   - Accept pull requests
