1/ Why "tools that build tools"?

Most devs build apps
Some devs build tools
Rare devs build meta-tools

PixelProdigy is meta-level:
❌ Don't model objects → Build object generators
❌ Don't create scenes → Build scene systems
❌ Don't place assets → Build placement automation

10x productivity for procedural content.
```

2/ Technical highlights:

• 6,388 lines of production code
• Custom GLSL shaders (GPU particles)
• Multi-layer frame capture
• WASD possession mode (control objects like game character)
• Real-time vertex dissolution
• 60 FPS with 50+ physics objects

All running in browser. No Unity. No Unreal. Pure WebGL.

## 💼 LINKEDIN PROFESSIONAL POST

💡 I spent 6 months building the tool that builds tools

Meta Horizon developers use creation tools.
Game devs use Unity/Unreal.
VR creators use specialized software.

I'm building the layer ABOVE that.

🎯 THE PROBLEM

Manual 3D workflows don't scale:
• Every object placed by hand
• Every variation modeled individually  
• Every environment hand-crafted

For procedural content, this is a bottleneck.

🔧 THE SOLUTION

PixelProdigy - A tool creation platform

Instead of building objects, build object generators.
Instead of creating scenes, create scene systems.
Instead of manual workflows, create automation pipelines.

📊 WHAT I BUILT

Core Systems:
• Multi-layer composition (like Photoshop for 3D)
• Real-time physics simulation (Cannon.js integration)
• GPU-accelerated effects (10k particles @ 60fps)
• Interactive object manipulation (WASD "possession mode")
• Professional rendering pipeline (studio lighting)
• All in WebGL - runs in any browser

Technical Stats:
• 6,388 lines of production code
• 60 FPS performance with 50+ physics objects
• Zero install required (browser-based)
• Custom GLSL shader programming

🚀 THE JOURNEY

Week 1: Simple HTML/CSS prototype
Week 8: Three.js integration
Week 16: Physics simulation
Week 20: GPU particle system
Week 24: Multi-layer composition
TODAY: Production-ready studio software

🎓 KEY LEARNINGS

1. Meta-level thinking unlocks scale
   (Build systems that build systems)

2. Browser tech is underrated
   (WebGL rivals desktop performance)

3. Start simple, iterate constantly
   (6 months of daily improvements)

4. Build what you need, not what's trendy
   (Solve real workflow problems)

🎯 USE CASES

Perfect for:
✅ Procedural environment generation
✅ Game development tool pipelines
✅ Spatial computing workflows (Meta Horizon, etc.)
✅ VR/AR asset creation
✅ Automated variation systems

🔗 PROJECT STATUS

Currently in production use
Patent pending on key features
Planning open-source core release
Accepting collaboration inquiries

Interested in:
• Spatial computing developers
• Game development tool creators
• VR/AR engineers
• WebGL/Three.js community
• Anyone working on procedural generation

Title: Built a production 3D studio entirely in WebGL - 6 month journey

I spent the last 6 months building PixelProdigy, a tool creation platform for 3D content.

Key features:
• Multi-layer composition system (like Photoshop for 3D)
• Real-time physics (Cannon.js - 60 FPS with 50+ objects)
• GPU particle system (custom GLSL shaders, 10k capacity)
• Interactive object manipulation (WASD "possession mode")
• Professional rendering (3-point lighting, soft shadows, tone mapping)

All running in browser, no install needed.

Tech stack:
- Three.js for rendering
- Cannon.js for physics  
- Custom GLSL shaders for particles
- 6,388 lines of vanilla JavaScript

Started as a simple webpage prototype, now it's production-ready software.

Demo: [link]
GitHub: [link]

Happy to answer questions about WebGL optimization, shader programming, 
or the architecture!

### r/threejs
```
Title: [Showcase] Multi-layer 3D studio with physics, particles, and object placement

Built a comprehensive Three.js application over 6 months.

Features:
• Multi-layer composition (isolation mode, frame capture)
• Object placement system (6 primitives)
• Real-time physics (Cannon.js integration)
• GPU particles (custom shaders, 5 types)
• Transform controls (move/rotate/scale)
• Possession mode (WASD control of objects)
• Professional lighting (3-point studio setup)

Performance: 60 FPS with 50+ physics objects + 5k particles

Some interesting challenges solved:
1. Multi-layer rendering without performance hit
2. Frame capture as background textures
3. Custom GLSL shaders for particles
4. Physics body creation for arbitrary shapes
5. Interactive transform controls

Code: [GitHub link]
Demo: [Live demo link]

Questions welcome! Especially about Three.js optimization 
or shader programming.

### r/gamedev

Title: Built a tool-building tool for procedural 3D content

Meta Horizon devs use tools to build environments.
I built the tool that builds those tools.

It's a browser-based 3D studio focused on:
- Procedural generation
- Tool pipeline creation
- Automated variations
- Layer-based composition

Why this matters for game dev:
✅ Build object generators, not individual objects
✅ Create scene systems, not manual scenes
✅ Automate repetitive placement tasks
✅ Generate infinite variations from rules

Built in WebGL (Three.js), runs in browser, 60 FPS performance.

Currently has:
• Multi-layer composition
• Real-time physics
• GPU particle system
• Interactive object placement
• Professional rendering

Next up: Lasso-guided laser cutting system (patent pending)

### Intro
```
Meta Horizon developers use creation tools.
Unity devs use the Unity editor.

✅ Why "tools for tools" thinking matters
✅ Technical challenges and solutions
✅ Architecture decisions (multi-layer, physics, particles)
✅ Performance optimization (60 FPS with 50+ objects)
✅ What I learned about WebGL, Three.js, and GLSL
✅ Where the project is going (laser cutting, explosions, fire)

Let's dive in...

## 🎤 HACKERNEWS POST

### Title
```
Show HN: PixelProdigy – 3D studio for building tools that build objects (WebGL)
```

### Post
```
I spent 6 months building a browser-based 3D studio focused on 
"meta-level" tool creation - tools that build other tools.

The idea: Instead of manually modeling objects, create systems 
that generate objects. Instead of placing assets by hand, build 
automation pipelines.

Built entirely in WebGL using Three.js and Cannon.js.

Key features:
- Multi-layer composition (Photoshop-like layers for 3D)
- Real-time physics (60 FPS with 50+ dynamic bodies)
- GPU particle system (10k capacity, custom GLSL shaders)
- Interactive object manipulation (WASD "possession mode")
- Professional rendering pipeline

6,388 lines of vanilla JavaScript. Zero framework bloat.

Next up: Patent-pending lasso-guided laser cutting system.

Happy to answer technical questions!
