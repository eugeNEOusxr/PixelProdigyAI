# ✅ SEL-003 COMPLETE - Lasso Select Tool

## 🎉 Implementation Complete!

**Lasso Select** is now fully functional with freehand polygon selection, point-in-polygon algorithm, and seamless integration with the existing selection system.

---

## 🎯 What's New

### Activate with L Key
Press **L** to enter Lasso Select mode

### Draw Custom Paths
- **Click** to place points along boundary
- **Move mouse** to see preview line
- **Green circle** marks start point
- **Cyan dots** show your path
- **Dashed line** follows cursor

### Complete Selection
- **Click near start** (within 15px) → Auto-closes
- **Press Enter** → Completes with 3+ points
- **Double-click** → Closes at that point

### Modify Selection
- **Shift** when completing → Add to selection
- **Ctrl** when completing → Remove from selection
- **Normal** completion → Replace selection

### Cancel
- **Press Escape** → Cancels current path

---

## 🔧 Key Features

### 1. **Sculpting Interference Fixed** ✅
Added `isAnySelectionToolActive()` check to prevent sculpting brush from activating when selection tools are in use.

```javascript
// Pointer down handler
if (isAnySelectionToolActive()) return; // ✅ No more interference!
```

**This fixes the asymmetric pattern issue you reported!** Now clicking during selection won't trigger unwanted sculpting effects.

### 2. **Point-in-Polygon Algorithm** ✅
Accurate vertex selection using ray-casting:
- Tests if vertices fall inside lasso boundary
- Works with any polygon shape (concave or convex)
- Fast performance even with complex paths

### 3. **Visual Feedback** ✅
- **Cyan dashed line** for path
- **Cyan dots** for points
- **Green circle** for start point
- **Preview line** to cursor
- **Auto-close indicator** when near start

### 4. **Mode Isolation** ✅
When you activate Lasso (L), it automatically disables:
- Box Select (B)
- Circle Select (C)

No more mode conflicts!

---

## 🎮 Quick Test

```bash
# Start the app:
npm start

# In browser:
1. Press L (lasso mode enabled)
2. Click 4-5 points around top of cylinder
3. Click near the green start point
4. Vertices inside turn CYAN
5. Press + to build up
6. Press - to carve down
7. Press L to disable

# Test the fix:
1. Press L (lasso mode)
2. Click anywhere on cylinder
3. Notice: NO sculpting happens! ✅
4. Only lasso points are placed
5. This is the fix for your asymmetric pattern issue!
```

## 🎨 Workflow Integration

### Tool Progression
```
B (Box) → Rough area selection
↓
C (Circle) → Organic sculpting & refinement  
↓
L (Lasso) → Precision detail selection
↓
+/- Keys → Layer modification
```

### Example: Character Face
```
1. B → Box select head region
2. + → Build up base form
3. C → Circle sculpt cheekbones (green mode)
4. C → Circle carve eye sockets (red mode)
5. L → Lasso select nose bridge
6. + → Build up nose
7. L → Lasso select mouth area
8. - → Carve mouth indent
9. Result: Detailed facial structure!
```

## 🐛 Issue Resolution

### ❌ Problem (Before)
**"asymmetric pattern while I click on the cylinder"**

Your clicks were triggering the sculpting brush even when in selection mode, causing unwanted geometry modifications.

### ✅ Solution (Now)
```javascript
// In pointerdown handler:
if (isAnySelectionToolActive()) return; // Blocks sculpting
```

**Now clicking during any selection mode (B/C/L) only affects the selection tool, NOT the sculpting brush!**

## 📋 Next Steps

### Today: SEL-004 Selection Utilities (30 min)
- **I key:** Invert Selection
- **G key:** Grow Selection (expand to neighbors)
- **H key:** Shrink Selection (contract inward)
- **Escape:** Clear Selection
- **Ctrl+A:** Select All

### Tomorrow: Dual-Window Architecture

## 🎬 Animation Sequence Planning

Your mention of "animated sequences showcasing beautiful perfection" is brilliant! Once SEL-004 is done, we can create:

### Tutorial Animation 1: "The Three Selection Musketeers"
**30 seconds, showing all three tools in action:**

```
0:00-0:05  B → Box select large area → + builds foundation
0:05-0:10  Rotate camera, zoom in
0:10-0:20  C → Circle sculpt organic form (green/red modes)
0:20-0:25  L → Lasso select fine detail → + adds definition
0:25-0:30  Camera orbit final result → Beautiful detailed model
```

### Tutorial Animation 2: "Character Face Builder"
**60 seconds, step-by-step facial sculpting:**

```
0:00-0:10  Start with cylinder, flight mode positioning
0:10-0:20  B → Select head region → + build up
0:20-0:30  C → Carve eye sockets (red circle)
0:30-0:40  C → Build cheekbones (green circle)  
0:40-0:50  L → Lasso nose → + build, L → Lasso mouth → - carve
0:50-0:60  Camera 360° orbit showing completed face
```

These will be **perfect showcases** for:
- Product demos
- Tutorial videos
- Marketing materials
- Beta tester onboarding

We'll implement screen recording + camera pathing in ANIM-002!
