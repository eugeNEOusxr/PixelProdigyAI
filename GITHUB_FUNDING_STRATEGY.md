# 💰 GitHub Funding Strategy for PixelProdigy

**Date:** October 19, 2025  
**Purpose:** Choose the right funding platforms for your business model  

---

## 🎯 YOUR BUSINESS MODEL

You're building a **SaaS product**, not a donation-based open-source project:

- ✅ Freemium tiers: Free → $9.99 → $29.99 → $99.99/month
- ✅ Marketplace: 85-95% revenue share to creators
- ✅ Commercial product with real revenue potential
- ✅ B2C (creators) + B2B (studios) customers

**This changes everything about funding!**

---

## 🚫 PLATFORMS TO AVOID

### **❌ Patreon** - Skip This
```yaml
# patreon: eugeneous  # DON'T USE

Why NOT Patreon:
❌ Takes 5-12% fees (expensive!)
❌ For ongoing content creators (YouTubers, artists)
❌ Donors feel entitled to features
❌ Competing with your own paid tiers
❌ You have Stripe already

Better alternative: Your own Stripe subscriptions
```

### **❌ Open Collective** - Skip This
```yaml
# open_collective: eugeneous  # DON'T USE

Why NOT Open Collective:
❌ For non-profits and open-source projects
❌ Transparent budgets (shows all your money)
❌ Fiscal sponsorship model (not for SaaS)
❌ Expects open governance
❌ You're not building commons

Better alternative: Your own payment system
```

### **❌ Tidelift** - Skip This
```yaml
# tidelift: npm/pixelprodigy  # DON'T USE

Why NOT Tidelift:
❌ Only for OSS package maintainers
❌ For npm/PyPI/Maven libraries
❌ You're building an app, not a library
❌ Enterprise-focused (wrong market)

Not applicable to your project
```

### **❌ Community Bridge** - Skip This
```yaml
# community_bridge: pixelprodigy  # DON'T USE

Why NOT Community Bridge:
❌ Linux Foundation projects only
❌ Large open-source initiatives
❌ Not for individual SaaS products

Way too enterprise for your stage
```

### **❌ Liberapay** - Skip This
```yaml
# liberapay: eugeneous  # DON'T USE

Why NOT Liberapay:
❌ Donation-based (you want subscriptions)
❌ Non-profit ethos (you're for-profit)
❌ Small user base
❌ Weekly/monthly donations (not purchases)

Better alternative: Stripe subscriptions
```

### **❌ IssueHunt** - Skip This
```yaml
# issuehunt: eugeneous  # DON'T USE

Why NOT IssueHunt:
❌ For bounties on GitHub issues
❌ Developers get paid, not maintainers
❌ Not a funding model (it's outsourcing)

Not relevant to your model
```

### **❌ LFX Crowdfunding** - Skip This
```yaml
# lfx_crowdfunding: pixelprodigy  # DON'T USE

Why NOT LFX:
❌ Linux Foundation projects
❌ Large infrastructure projects
❌ Not for SaaS startups

Way too big for your stage
```

### **❌ Polar** - Skip This
```yaml
# polar: eugeneous  # DON'T USE

Why NOT Polar:
❌ New platform (risky)
❌ For open-source maintainers
❌ Still in beta/early stage
❌ Small user base

Too experimental right now
```

### **❌ thanks.dev** - Skip This
```yaml
# thanks_dev: eugeneous  # DON'T USE

Why NOT thanks.dev:
❌ Dependency-based donations
❌ For npm package maintainers
❌ Analyzes GitHub stars/dependencies
❌ Not for end-user products

Not applicable to SaaS
```

---

## ✅ PLATFORMS TO USE

### **1. Custom Links (BEST CHOICE)** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
```yaml
custom: [
  'https://eugeneous.dev/pricing',           # Your actual product
  'https://myplace.eugeneous.com',           # Your marketplace
  'https://eugeneous.dev',                   # Your homepage
  'https://discord.gg/pixelprodigy'          # Your community
]

Why USE Custom Links:
✅ Direct to YOUR payment system (Stripe)
✅ No platform fees (except Stripe 2.9%)
✅ Full control over pricing/tiers
✅ Builds YOUR brand (not platform's)
✅ Can track conversions properly
✅ Professional appearance

This is the RIGHT choice for SaaS!
```

### **2. Ko-fi (OPTIONAL)** ⭐⭐⭐⭐
```yaml
ko_fi: eugeneous  # Use for tips/one-time support

Why USE Ko-fi:
✅ 0% fees on one-time tips
✅ Good for small supporters (<$5)
✅ Simple "buy me a coffee" psychology
✅ Doesn't compete with subscriptions
✅ Easy setup (5 minutes)
✅ Can add to README as "tip jar"

Use case: Fans who want to tip but not subscribe
```

### **3. Buy Me a Coffee (ALTERNATIVE TO KO-FI)** ⭐⭐⭐⭐
```yaml
buy_me_a_coffee: eugeneous  # Alternative to Ko-fi

Why USE Buy Me a Coffee:
✅ 5% fee (reasonable)
✅ Memberships available
✅ One-time + recurring support
✅ More popular than Ko-fi
✅ Nice UI/branding

Use case: Same as Ko-fi, choose ONE (not both)
```

### **4. GitHub Sponsors (MAYBE LATER)** ⭐⭐⭐
```yaml
github: [eugeneous]  # Enable after 1,000+ stars

Why WAIT on GitHub Sponsors:
✅ 0% fees (GitHub pays them!)
✅ Integrated in GitHub UI
✅ Good for OSS contributors
⚠️ Requires approval (not instant)
⚠️ Best for established projects
⚠️ Competes with your paid tiers

Wait until: 1,000+ stars, 10+ contributors
```

---

## 🎯 RECOMMENDED SETUP

### **Phase 1: Launch (NOW)**
```yaml
# .github/FUNDING.yml

custom: [
  'https://eugeneous.dev/pricing',
  'https://myplace.eugeneous.com',
  'https://eugeneous.dev',
  'https://discord.gg/pixelprodigy'
]

  'https://eugeneous.dev',
  'https://discord.gg/pixelprodigy'
]

Why:

```

```yaml
# .github/FUNDING.yml

github: [eugeneous]
ko_fi: eugeneous

custom: [
  'https://eugeneous.dev/pricing',
  'https://myplace.eugeneous.com'
]

## 💰 REVENUE MODEL COMPARISON

### **❌ Donation Model (BAD for you)**
```
Monthly donations: $50-500/month
- Inconsistent income
- Can't scale
- Feels like charity
- Competes with paid tiers

Not sustainable for SaaS!
```

### **✅ Subscription Model (GOOD for you)**
```
Monthly subscriptions: $1,000-10,000+/month
- Predictable revenue
- Scales with users
- Professional image
- Proper business model

This is YOUR model!
```

---

## 🎯 MESSAGING STRATEGY

### **Don't Say:**
❌ "Support this project"  
❌ "Donate to help development"  
❌ "Buy me a coffee"  
❌ "Sponsor my work"  

### **Do Say:**
✅ "Get PixelProdigy Pro"  
✅ "Upgrade for premium features"  
✅ "Unlock professional tools"  
✅ "Start creating today"  

You're selling a **product**, not asking for **charity**.

## 📝 README BADGE EXAMPLES

### **Good Badge (Product Focus):**
```markdown
[![Get PixelProdigy Pro](https://img.shields.io/badge/Get-PixelProdigy%20Pro-FFD700?style=for-the-badge&logo=stripe)](https://eugeneous.dev/pricing)
```

### **Okay Badge (Tip Jar):**
```markdown
[![Support on Ko-fi](https://img.shields.io/badge/Ko--fi-Support%20Development-FF5E5B?style=flat&logo=ko-fi)](https://ko-fi.com/eugeneous)
```

### **Bad Badge (Charity Vibe):**
```markdown
❌ [![Donate](https://img.shields.io/badge/Donate-Please%20Help-red)](...)
```

---

## ✅ FINAL RECOMMENDATION

### **For PixelProdigy (SaaS Product):**

```yaml
# .github/FUNDING.yml

# Your product (main focus)
custom: [
  'https://eugeneous.dev/pricing',
  'https://myplace.eugeneous.com',
  'https://eugeneous.dev'
]

# Optional tip jar (for fans)
# ko_fi: eugeneous  # Add later if needed
```

### **Why This Setup:**
1. ✅ Direct users to YOUR product
2. ✅ No platform fees (except Stripe)
3. ✅ Professional appearance
4. ✅ Full control over experience
5. ✅ Scalable business model
6. ✅ Clear call-to-action

---

## 🎉 ACTION ITEMS

- [x] Create `.github/FUNDING.yml` with custom links
- [ ] Remove all donation-platform comments
- [ ] Link to your pricing page (primary)
- [ ] Link to MyPlace marketplace (secondary)
- [ ] Test "Sponsor" button on GitHub
- [ ] Update README with product badges
- [ ] Track conversions in analytics

---

## 💡 PRO TIP

**Ko-fi is optional**. Only add it if you see users asking "how can I tip you for this?"

Most successful SaaS products **don't have tip jars** because:
- It dilutes the premium offering
- Makes product feel like charity
- Confuses pricing strategy
- Low conversion ($5 tip vs $10 subscription)

**Keep it simple:** Direct to your paid tiers!

---

## 🚀 READY TO DEPLOY

Your FUNDING.yml is already set up with the best strategy:
- Custom links to your products
- No confusing donation platforms
- Professional SaaS appearance
- Maximum conversion potential

**Commit and push!**

```bash
git add .github/FUNDING.yml
git commit -m "Add GitHub funding links to products"
git push
```

**Check it works:**
1. Go to your GitHub repo
2. Look for "Sponsor" button (❤️)
3. Click it
4. See your custom links!

**You're selling a product, not asking for donations. Act like it!** 💪✨
