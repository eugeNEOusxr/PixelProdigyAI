## 💡 Key Innovations Protected

### **Next Up** (Week 2-3)

- 🔄 FRAG-001: Fragmentation System (6-8 hours)### 1. 🎯 Lasso-Guided Laser Cutting ⭐⭐⭐

- 🔄 VFX-001: Particle Effects (8-10 hours)

- 🔄 DESTRUCT-001: Explosions (6-8 hours)**Status:** Patent Pending (provisional planned)  

**Market:** No competitor has this feature  

---**Value:** Killer feature, main differentiator



## 💡 KEY INSIGHTS**What It Is:**

- Draw lasso path on screen (L key)

### **1. Lasso-Based Workflow is Genius**- Press Shift+L to activate cutting mode

The two-step lasso process (GREEN → YELLOW) is incredibly intuitive. Users naturally understand what's happening.- Laser follows path exactly

- Creates molten edges, sparks, smoke

### **2. Visual Feedback is Critical**- Separates object into pieces with physics

The color-coded tethers and pulsing animation make the invisible (physics constraints) visible.

**Why It Matters:**

### **3. Multi-Binding is Powerful**- Artistic freedom (freehand cutting)

Staying in binding mode after creating a binding allows rapid chaining of multiple objects.- Intuitive workflow (no complex tools)

- Visual spectacle (VFX included)

### **4. Physics Integration is Seamless**- Patent-protectable (unique implementation)

Cannon.js constraints "just work" - no fighting the physics engine.

---

### **5. Error Handling Matters**

Auto-creating physics bodies and showing clear warnings makes the system robust and user-friendly.### 2. 🪟 Dual-Window Architecture ⭐⭐



---**Status:** Trade Secret + Design Patents (future)  

**Market:** No browser-based tool offers this  

## 🎬 DEMO SCENARIOS**Value:** Revolutionary workflow



### **Scenario 1: Suspension Bridge****What It Is:**

```- Human Sculpt Window (manual control)

Build a bridge with elastic cables:- AI Studio Window (procedural generation)

- Real-time sync (LocalStorage/WebSocket)

1. Alt+L, Press 2 (elastic)- Independent workflows, combined output

2. Lasso left tower → GREEN

3. Lasso bridge deck → YELLOW**Why It Matters:**

   → Yellow cable created- Human creativity + AI power

4. Lasso bridge deck → GREEN  - Separate interfaces optimize each

5. Lasso right tower → YELLOW- Real-time collaboration

   → Yellow cable created- Scalable to 3+ windows



Result: Bridge suspended by elastic cables!---

Apply weight → cables stretch

Remove weight → cables pull bridge up### 3. 🧬 GENE Compression ⭐⭐⭐

```

**Status:** Patent Pending (provisional planned)  

### **Scenario 2: Building Demolition****Market:** 250-4800x ratios unmatched  

```**Value:** Enables mobile VR streaming

Bind building floors for realistic collapse:

**What It Is:**

1. Alt+L, Press 1 (rigid)- Genetic-style encoding algorithm

2. Lasso foundation → GREEN- Compresses geometry + animation

3. Lasso floor 1 → YELLOW- 250x minimum, 4800x maximum ratios

4. Continue up the building...- Lossy but perceptually accurate



Result: All floors bound together**Why It Matters:**

Apply explosion → Entire building collapses as unit!- Technical barrier to replication

```- Measurable performance advantage

- Unlocks new use cases (mobile, streaming)

---- Proprietary algorithm
