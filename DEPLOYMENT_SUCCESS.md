## 💰 ABOUT YOUR DONATIONS PAGE

You mentioned: "I need to take off my donations page"

**Don't worry!** Your FUNDING.yml is set up CORRECTLY:

```yaml
# .github/FUNDING.yml
custom: [
  'https://eugeneous.dev/pricing',           # Your Stripe products
  'https://myplace.eugeneous.com',           # Your marketplace
  'https://eugeneous.dev',                   # Your homepage
  'https://discord.gg/pixelprodigy'          # Your community
]
```

**NO donation platforms!** ✅
- No Patreon ✅
- No Ko-fi ✅

- Only YOUR product links ✅

This is **perfect for a SaaS product**. You're selling subscriptions, not asking for donations.

```yaml
custom: [
  'https://buy.stripe.com/your-creator-tier-link',
