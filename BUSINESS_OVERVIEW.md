## 🎓 You're Building a "Social Enterprise"

- **Nonprofit arm** (Foundation): Social impact, tax benefits, grant funding
- **Blockchain integration**: Modern payment rails, global reach, transparency

**Famous examples of this model:**
- TOMS Shoes (for-profit + giving program)
- Warby Parker (for-profit + donate glasses)
- Khan Academy (nonprofit + corporate sponsorships)

**Your unique twist:**
- Using cryptocurrency for direct payments
- Backing tokens with real estate (stablecoin-like)
- Virtual training before physical transition
- AI-powered skill matching

## 📊 Market Positioning

### PixelProdigy (Commercial):
**You're competing with:** Blender, Maya, Cinema 4D, ZBrush  
**Your differentiation:** Browser-based, AI-assisted, no downloads, modular pricing

### MyPlace (Social Impact):
**You're competing with:** Traditional job training programs (often boring, low retention)  
**Your differentiation:** Gamified, earn while you learn, crypto payments, virtual-first

### Combined Value Prop:
**"The only 3D software company that actively fights homelessness while building cutting-edge creative tools."**

This gives you:
- **Marketing story** (press loves social impact + tech)
- **Tax benefits** (nonprofit arm)
- **Talent attraction** (developers want to work on meaningful projects)
- **Grant funding** (government money for social good)
- **Customer loyalty** ("Buy our software, help end homelessness")

## 🚀 What to Tell People

**Elevator Pitch (30 seconds):**
> "I'm Jeremy, founder of PixelProdigy. We build professional 3D software that runs entirely in your browser—no downloads needed. We also run a nonprofit that teaches homeless individuals marketable skills through virtual training while paying them in cryptocurrency. It's creative tech meets social impact."

**Investor Pitch (2 minutes):**
> "PixelProdigy is disrupting the $5 billion 3D software market with browser-based tools powered by AI. Our freemium model attracts millions of users, while our $29-99/month tiers generate recurring revenue. Unique twist: profits fund our 501(c)(3) foundation, which trains homeless individuals using our platform and pays them in our utility token (backed by real estate). This creates a flywheel: more users → more revenue → more social impact → more press → more users. We're targeting $1M ARR in Year 1 from SaaS alone, plus $2M in grant funding for the nonprofit."

**Grant Application Summary:**
> "PixelProdigy Foundation provides innovative job training for homeless individuals through immersive virtual simulations. Participants learn 3D modeling, coding, and mechanical skills while earning income through cryptocurrency rewards. Our program combines gamification (high engagement) with real-world skill development (job placement), addressing the root cause of homelessness: lack of marketable skills and income."
