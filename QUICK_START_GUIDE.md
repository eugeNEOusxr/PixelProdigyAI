## ðŸŽ¯ Step-by-Step Instructions

### Phase 1: Install Dependencies (5 minutes)

```bash
cd /home/jeremy/PixelProdigyAI/object_generator

# Install Python packages
pip3 install requests serpapi

# Verify installation
python3 -c "import requests; import serpapi; print('âœ… Ready!')"
```

### Phase 2: Configure API Keys (2 minutes)

1. Get your SerpApi key from https://serpapi.com/manage-api-key
2. Get your Meshy AI key from https://meshy.ai/api

```bash
# Option A: Set environment variables (recommended)
export SERPAPI_KEY="your_serpapi_key_here"
export MESHY_API_KEY="your_meshy_key_here"

# Option B: Edit scripts directly
nano image_scraper.py  # Add API_KEY = "your_key" at top
nano image_to_3d_converter.py  # Add API_KEY = "your_key" at top
```

### Phase 3: Scrape Images (1-2 hours)

**Test Mode (FREE - 100 images)**
```bash
# This uses the free SerpApi tier
python3 image_scraper.py
```

This will:
- Search Google Images for 10 queries per category
- Download ~20 images per query
- Save to `scraped_images/` folder
- Create `metadata.json` with image info
- Total: ~200 images (10 categories Ã— 20 images)

**Production Mode ($50 - 2,000 images)**
```bash
# Edit image_scraper.py and uncomment full query lists
# Then run:
python3 image_scraper.py
```

### Phase 4: Convert to 3D Models (30 minutes - 2 days)

**Test Mode ($10 - 50 models)**
```bash
python3 image_to_3d_converter.py
# Choose option 1: Test mode (5 images per category)
```

This will:
- Convert 50 images to 3D models (5 per category)
- Cost: 50 Ã— $0.20 = $10
- Time: ~4 minutes per model = 3-4 hours total
- Output: `generated_objects/models/[category]/[object].glb`

**Small Batch ($100 - 500 models)**
```bash
python3 image_to_3d_converter.py
# Choose option 2: Small batch (50 per category)
```
- Cost: 500 Ã— $0.20 = $100
- Time: ~33 hours (can run overnight)

**Full Production ($1000+ - 5,000 models)**
```bash
python3 image_to_3d_converter.py
# Choose option 3: Full conversion
```
- Cost: Depends on images scraped
- Time: 2-3 days (run on server)
- Recommendation: Do this in batches

### Phase 5: Update Object Metadata (10 minutes)

```bash
# Update existing object JSON files to point to real models
node update_object_metadata.js
```

This will:
- Read all object JSON files in `generated_objects/`
- Check if corresponding GLB model exists in `models/`
- Update `visual.model.hasRealModel = true`
- Update `visual.model.path` to point to GLB file

### Phase 6: Test in Browser (5 minutes)

```bash
# Start server (if not already running)
cd /home/jeremy/PixelProdigyAI
python3 -m http.server 8001
```

Open browser to: http://localhost:8001/object_browser/

You should now see:
- âœ… Objects with real 3D models load GLB files
- âœ… Objects without real models use procedural generation
- âœ… Smooth 60fps rotation
- âœ… Better visual quality for real models

## ðŸ’° Cost Breakdown

### Scenario A: Minimal Test ($10)
- 50 models converted
- Covers 1-2 objects per category
- Perfect for testing the pipeline
- **Total: $10**

### Scenario B: Key Objects Only ($100)
- 500 models converted
- Focus on:
  - All "Legendary" objects (4.5% = ~2,100 objects)
  - All "Epic" objects (13.4% = ~6,300 objects)
  - Selected "Rare" objects
- Fallback to procedural for "Common"
- **Total: $100**

### Scenario C: Premium Objects ($500)
- 2,500 models converted
- All rare/epic/legendary objects
- Best-selling furniture items
- Procedural for common items
- **Total: $500**

### Scenario D: Everything ($2,000-$4,000)
- All 10,000-20,000 unique base models
- Use variations (colors/sizes) from same base
- Professional-quality marketplace
- **Total: $2,000-$4,000**

**RECOMMENDED: Start with Scenario B ($100)**

## ðŸŽ¯ Smart Strategy: Hybrid Approach

### The 80/20 Rule

Convert 20% of objects (the best ones) â†’ 80% of visual impact

**Priority List:**
1. **Legendary & Epic** (18% of objects) â†’ Always use real models
2. **Rare Furniture** (seating, tables, sofas) â†’ Use real models
3. **Featured Items** (Sky Mansion specific) â†’ Use real models
4. **Common Items** (basic objects) â†’ Procedural generation

### Cost Optimization

Instead of converting all 47,000 objects:
1. Identify 5,000 unique base objects
2. Convert to 3D: 5,000 Ã— $0.20 = **$1,000**
3. Create 9-10 variants (colors/sizes) from each base
4. Result: 50,000 objects for $1,000 instead of $9,400

**Savings: $8,400 (90%)**

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

### Issue: "No API key provided"
**Solution:** Set environment variables or edit scripts directly

### Issue: "Rate limit exceeded"
**Solution:** Add `time.sleep(5)` between requests

### Issue: "Model conversion failed"
**Solution:** 
- Check image quality (needs clear product photo)
- Try different image from same query
- Meshy AI works best with white/plain backgrounds

### Issue: "GLB model won't load in browser"
**Solution:**
- Check file path is correct
- Verify CORS headers (serve from same domain)
- Check browser console for errors

### Issue: "Conversion taking too long"
**Solution:**
- Run in batches (100 at a time)
- Use cloud server with better internet
- Consider Luma AI (faster, 1-2 min per model)
