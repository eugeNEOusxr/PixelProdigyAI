## 🔄 Workflow
1. **Main**: Anatomical body system development
2. **Feature branches**: Other projects/features
3. **Merge strategy**: Keep main clean, merge features when stable

## �� Notes
- Main branch now focused exclusively on anatomy system
- Business/marketing content isolated in feature branch
- Game improvements in separate branch for clarity
- Easy to merge back when needed via PR
