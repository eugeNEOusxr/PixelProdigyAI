    "https://example.com/table-product.jpg",
    # Add 20-50 URLs
]

output_dir = Path("scraped_images/furniture")
output_dir.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)

for i, url in enumerate(urls):
    response = requests.get(url)
    if response.status_code == 200:
        with open(output_dir / f"product_{i}.jpg", 'wb') as f:
            f.write(response.content)
        print(f"‚úÖ Downloaded: product_{i}.jpg")
```
