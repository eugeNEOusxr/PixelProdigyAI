# ‚úÖ GitHub Repository Topics - How to Add

Since the GitHub CLI doesn't have permission to modify topics via API, here's how to add them manually:

## Method 1: GitHub Web Interface (Recommended)

1. **Go to your repository**: https://github.com/eugeNEOusxr/PixelProdigyAI

2. **Click the ‚öôÔ∏è gear icon** next to "About" (top right of repository page)

3. **In the "Topics" field**, add these topics (press Enter after each):
   ```
   ai
   game-development
   education
   3d
   recovery-support
   training-simulation
   procedural-generation
   webgl
   threejs
   social-impact
   edtech
   gene-compression
   blockchain
   solana
   web3
   zero-download
   educational-game
   addiction-recovery
   vertex-compression
   webassembly
   ```

4. **Click "Save changes"**

## Method 2: Using GitHub API Directly

If you have a personal access token with `repo` scope:

```bash
curl -X PUT \
  -H "Authorization: token YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN" \
  -H "Accept: application/vnd.github.v3+json" \
  https://api.github.com/repos/eugeNEOusxr/PixelProdigyAI/topics \
  -d '{"names":["ai","game-development","education","3d","recovery-support","training-simulation","procedural-generation","webgl","threejs","social-impact","edtech","gene-compression","blockchain","solana","web3","zero-download","educational-game","addiction-recovery","vertex-compression","webassembly"]}'
```
