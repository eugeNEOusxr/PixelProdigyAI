### 10. **SUBDIVISION SURFACES** ‚Üí Edwin Catmull & Jim Clark (1978)
**Edwin Catmull:** Pixar co-founder (again!)  
**Jim Clark:** Founded Silicon Graphics (SGI) and Netscape  
**Year:** 1978  
**Discovery:** Smooth mesh refinement algorithm  
**Impact:** Both became tech billionaires from their contributions
