# üéØ PIXELPRODIGY AI - COMPREHENSIVE BUILD PLAN

## üìä Current Status (October 17, 2025)

### ‚úÖ Completed Features (12/20)

#### Core Environment System

  - Separated selection from modification (critical refactor)
  - +/- keys for explicit build/carve operations
  
- ‚úÖ **SEL-002: Circle Select** - Radius-based brush selection
  - C key toggle, mouse wheel radius adjustment (10-200px)
  - Real-time selection as cursor moves

## üé® Circle Select - Key Innovation

The Circle Select tool is a **game-changer** for organic sculpting:

### How It Works
```
1. Press C ‚Üí Circle appears at cursor
2. Scroll wheel ‚Üí Adjust radius (10-200px)
3. Move mouse ‚Üí Vertices inside turn cyan (selected)
4. Press + ‚Üí Circle turns GREEN (build mode)
5. Move mouse ‚Üí Geometry builds up in real-time
6. Press - ‚Üí Circle turns RED (carve mode)
7. Move mouse ‚Üí Geometry carves away in real-time
```

### Why It's Revolutionary
- **Real-time sculpting brush** - Not just selection, but live modification
- **Visual feedback** - Color-coded modes (cyan/green/red)
- **Intuitive workflow** - Feels like painting with clay
- **Perfect for organics** - Characters, terrain, creatures
- **Rapid iteration** - Toggle between build/carve instantly

### Use Cases
1. **Character Sculpting:** Build cheekbones, carve eye sockets, add muscle definition
2. **Terrain Design:** Create hills (build), carve valleys, add craters
3. **Detail Work:** Add scales, wrinkles, pores with small radius
4. **Organic Shapes:** Smooth, flowing modifications without hard edges

## üéâ What Makes This Special

### The Vision
**AI and Human working together** on two screens, each with specialized tools, creating in real-time, synchronized, with 144 AI personalities providing expertise, compressing to GENE language for instant sharing, rendering to 4K for production quality, all at a fraction of traditional 3D software cost.

### The Innovation
**Circle Select with real-time build/carve** is just the beginning. Imagine:
- AI suggesting next brush stroke
- Procedural patterns applied with circle brush
- Style transfer within selection
- Text-to-geometry in AI window appearing in human window instantly
- Animation timeline scrubbing while viewing real-time 4K preview

### The Opportunity
**$2 billion 3D software market** dominated by expensive legacy tools (Blender is free but hard, ZBrush is $895, Maya is $1,875/year). We're offering professional quality at consumer prices with AI assistance.
