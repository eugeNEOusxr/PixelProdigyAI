# üéØ AbilityManager Fix - COMPLETE

## Problem Identified ‚úÖ

**Error:** `TypeError: playerAbilityManager.addAbility is not a function`

**Root Cause:**
- The `AbilityManager` class doesn't have an `addAbility()` method
- `AbilityManager` requires a player object parameter in constructor
- Abilities are pre-defined in the `SkillTree` class, not added dynamically
- The code was trying to use an old API that doesn't exist

---

## Solution Implemented ‚úÖ

### 1. Fixed AbilityManager Initialization
Created a player data object to pass to AbilityManager:
```javascript
const playerData = {
    get mana() { return playerCombatStats ? playerCombatStats.mana : 100; },
    set mana(val) { if (playerCombatStats) playerCombatStats.mana = val; },
    get health() { return playerCombatStats ? playerCombatStats.health : 100; },
    set health(val) { if (playerCombatStats) playerCombatStats.health = val; },
    level: playerLevel || 1
};

playerAbilityManager = new AbilityManager(playerData);
```

### 2. Unlocked Pre-existing Abilities
Instead of trying to add new abilities, we:
- Awarded skill points (10 points)
- Unlocked existing abilities from SkillTree: `fireball`, `dash`, `heal`
- Assigned them to hotbar slots (1, 2, 3)

### 3. Overrode onActivate Functions
Replaced the default ability effects with our custom visual effects:
- **Fireball**: Calls `createFireballEffect()` and shows damage indicator
- **Dash**: Applies velocity boost (`velocity.x *= 3; velocity.z *= 3`)
- **Heal**: Calls `createHealEffect()` and heals player

### 4. Updated Keyboard Controls
Changed from direct ability calls to hotbar system:
```javascript
// OLD: playerAbilityManager.useAbility('fireball');
// NEW: playerAbilityManager.useHotbarSlot(0);
```

### 5. Added Cooldown Updates
Added `playerAbilityManager.update(delta)` to the animate loop to update ability cooldowns.

## How It Works Now

The **Skills & Abilities System** (`skills_abilities_system.js`) provides:
- **SkillTree**: 30+ predefined abilities in 3 branches (Combat/Magic/Utility)
- **Ability**: Individual ability with cooldowns, costs, effects
- **Hotbar**: 9-slot hotbar for quick access
- **AbilityManager**: Manages unlocking, using, and updating abilities

**Flow:**
1. Player presses `1`, `2`, or `3`
2. Calls `playerAbilityManager.useHotbarSlot(index)`
3. Hotbar looks up ability ID
4. AbilityManager checks if ability is unlocked and off cooldown
5. Ability checks resource costs (mana/health)
6. Ability executes `onActivate` callback (our custom effects)
7. Cooldown starts, resources consumed

## Available Abilities

| Key | Ability  | Cost     | Cooldown | Effect                           |
|-----|----------|----------|----------|----------------------------------|
| `1` | Fireball | 20 mana  | 2.0s     | Fire projectile, 25 damage       |
| `2` | Dash     | 15 mana  | 5.0s     | Speed boost forward              |
| `3` | Heal     | 25 mana  | 10.0s    | Restore 50 health                |

*More abilities exist in SkillTree but aren't unlocked yet*

---

## Future Expansion

The system supports:
- **Skill Points**: Award on level up to unlock more abilities
- **Prerequisites**: Some abilities require others to be unlocked first
- **Upgrades**: Abilities can be upgraded with skill points
- **Passive Abilities**: Always-active effects
- **More Abilities**: 30+ abilities already defined in SkillTree

To unlock more abilities:
```javascript
playerAbilityManager.awardSkillPoints(5);
playerAbilityManager.skillTree.unlockAbility('lightning_bolt');
playerAbilityManager.hotbar.assignSlot(3, 'lightning_bolt');
```

## Files Modified

- `skyrelics_world.html`:
  - Fixed `initializeSkillsSystem()` to use correct API
  - Updated keyboard controls to use hotbar system
  - Added ability cooldown updates in animate loop

## Testing Checklist

‚úÖ No syntax errors  
‚è≥ Test in browser:
- Press `1` for Fireball (should see projectile)
- Press `2` for Dash (should move faster)
- Press `3` for Heal (should restore health)
- Verify cooldowns work (can't spam abilities)
- Verify mana consumption
