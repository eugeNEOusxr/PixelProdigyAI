### ‚òê Provisional Patent: Lasso-Guided Laser ($300)

**Why:** Protects your killer feature - no one else has this

**Steps:**
1. [ ] Draft patent document (DIY template):

```markdown
# PROVISIONAL PATENT APPLICATION

## Title
Method and System for Lasso-Guided Laser Cutting of 3D Objects

## Inventors
Jeremy [Full Name]
[Address]

## Abstract
A novel method for cutting three-dimensional objects using a freehand 
screen-space path that is projected into 3D space and used to guide a 
virtual laser cutting beam. The system enables intuitive, artistic 
cutting of complex 3D geometry with real-time visual feedback.

## Background
Existing 3D modeling software requires multiple steps to define cutting 
planes or surfaces. Users must manually position planar cutters or use 
boolean operations, which are time-consuming and lack artistic freedom.

## Summary of Invention
The present invention provides a system where users draw a freehand 2D 
path on screen (lasso), which is projected into 3D space along the 
camera view frustum. This path guides a virtual laser beam that cuts 
through 3D objects, creating clean separation with visual effects 
(molten edges, sparks, smoke).

## Detailed Description

### System Architecture
1. User Input Layer
   - Mouse/stylus captures 2D screen coordinates
   - Path stored as array of [x, y] points
   - Real-time visual feedback (cyan line)

2. 3D Projection Layer
   - Screen coordinates converted to 3D ray via camera.unproject()
   - Ray extends from camera through 3D space
   - Path becomes series of 3D line segments

3. Cutting Algorithm
   - Iterate through geometry vertices
   - Calculate distance from each vertex to cutting path
   - Vertices within threshold flagged for separation
   - Generate new geometry along cut line

4. Visual Effects
   - Molten edge shader (orange/yellow gradient)
   - Particle emitter at cut point (sparks, smoke)
   - Heat distortion post-process effect
   - Sound effect (laser beam, sizzle)

### Claims
1. A method for cutting 3D geometry comprising:
   a) Receiving freehand input defining a 2D path on a display screen
   b) Projecting said 2D path into 3D space using camera perspective
   c) Generating a cutting surface from the projected 3D path
   d) Identifying vertices of 3D object intersecting said surface
   e) Fragmenting geometry into separate pieces along cut line
   f) Applying visual effects to cut edges (molten appearance)

2. The method of claim 1, wherein the 2D input is captured via lasso 
   selection tool with continuous mouse movement.

3. The method of claim 1, wherein visual effects include particle 
   systems simulating sparks, smoke, and heat distortion.

4. The method of claim 1, wherein the system operates in real-time 
   within a web browser using WebGL rendering.

[... add 5-10 more claims covering variations]

## Drawings
[Include screenshots/diagrams of:
 - Fig 1: User drawing lasso path on screen
 - Fig 2: 3D projection of path through object
 - Fig 3: Cut object with molten edges
 - Fig 4: System architecture flowchart]
```

2. [ ] File with USPTO:
   - Go to: https://www.uspto.gov/patents/apply
   - Select "Provisional Application"
   - Upload PDF of your document
   - Pay $60-$300 filing fee (depending on entity size)

3. [ ] Save confirmation:
   - [ ] Patent application number
   - [ ] Filing date (your priority date!)
   - [ ] Receipt

4. [ ] Mark code with "Patent Pending":
   - Already done in copyright headers ‚úÖ

**Critical:** File BEFORE any public demos or YouTube videos!  
**Timeline:** 12 months to convert to full utility patent

## üíæ BACKUP SYSTEM (Cost: $100)

### ‚òê Encrypted Backup Strategy

**Why:** Protect against hardware failure, theft, ransomware

**Steps:**
1. [ ] Buy 2x USB drives (32GB each, ~$20 total)
   - Sandisk or Samsung branded (reliable)

2. [ ] Install VeraCrypt (free encryption):
   - Download: https://www.veracrypt.fr/en/Downloads.html
   - Create encrypted volume on each USB
   - Use strong password (20+ characters)
   - Write password in physical notebook (not digital!)

3. [ ] Set up automated backup script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# File: ~/scripts/backup_pixelprodigy.sh

DATE=$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)
SOURCE="/home/jeremy/PixelProdigyAI"
USB1="/media/jeremy/BACKUP_USB1"
USB2="/media/jeremy/BACKUP_USB2"

# Git commit before backup
cd "$SOURCE"
git add .
git commit -m "Auto-backup $DATE"

# Backup to USB 1
if [ -d "$USB1" ]; then
  tar -czf "$USB1/pixelprodigy_$DATE.tar.gz" "$SOURCE"
  echo "Backup to USB1 complete: $DATE"
fi

# Backup to USB 2 (weekly)
if [ -d "$USB2" ] && [ $(date +%w) -eq 0 ]; then
  tar -czf "$USB2/pixelprodigy_weekly_$DATE.tar.gz" "$SOURCE"
  echo "Weekly backup to USB2 complete: $DATE"
fi
```

4. [ ] Make script executable:
```bash
chmod +x ~/scripts/backup_pixelprodigy.sh
```

5. [ ] Add to cron (automatic daily backup):
```bash
crontab -e
# Add line:
0 3 * * * /home/jeremy/scripts/backup_pixelprodigy.sh
```

6. [ ] Cloud backup (encrypted):
   - [ ] Install rclone: `sudo apt install rclone`
   - [ ] Configure Google Drive: `rclone config`
   - [ ] Encrypt before upload:
   ```bash
   tar -czf - PixelProdigyAI | \
     gpg --symmetric --cipher-algo AES256 | \
     rclone rcat googledrive:PixelProdigy/backup_$DATE.tar.gz.gpg
   ```

**Backup Locations:**
- USB 1 (daily) - Keep at home
- USB 2 (weekly) - Store at friend's house or work
- Cloud (weekly) - Google Drive encrypted
