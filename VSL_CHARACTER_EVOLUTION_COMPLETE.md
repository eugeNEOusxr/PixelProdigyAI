## Performance Metrics

### Mesh Count Comparison
| Version | Meshes | Increase |
|---------|--------|----------|
| Basic VSL | ~20 | - |
| + Facial Features | ~31 | +55% |
| + Ultra Anatomy | ~366 | +1,730% |

### Polygon Count (estimated)

## Testing Checklist

### Visual Inspection
- [ ] Press **V** for third-person view
- [ ] Rotate camera 360¬∞ around character
- [ ] Check facial features (mouth, teeth, nostrils)
- [ ] Verify muscle definition (arms, chest)
