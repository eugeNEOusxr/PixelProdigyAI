## 🎯 DEMO RESULTS

### Combat System (C++)
```
⚔️  COMBAT START!
Warrior (HP: 150) vs Dark Mage (HP: 120)

Round 1:
- Warrior dealt 41 damage (Physical)

🏆 WINNER: Warrior (24.6 HP remaining)
```

**Performance**: <1ms per combat tick ✅

---

### AI Narrative Engine (JavaScript)
```
📖 COMBAT NARRATIVE:

"With brutal efficiency, Aria the Brave crushed Malachar the 
Corruptor's defenses and emerged victorious. The final blow 
was a devastating critical strike that echoed across the 
battlefield. A 7-hit combo left no room for Malachar the 
Corruptor to recover. Aria the Brave survived by a thread, 
battered but unbroken."
```

**Output**: narrative_history.json with full story ✅

---

### Character Transformation
```
⚡ TRANSFORMATION NARRATIVE:

"Disillusioned by the world's cruelty, Aria the Brave became 
the monster they hunted. Betrayed by those she swore to protect. 
Those who knew Aria the Brave before can hardly recognize them now."

→ Hero transformed into Villain
→ Stats modified: +30% attack, -20% defense
→ Personality changed: Defensive → Aggressive
```

**Integration**: Combat outcomes trigger narrative transformations ✅

## 🔮 ADVANCED FEATURES

### Multi-Battle Narratives

The system tracks **battle history** and generates connected narratives:

```javascript
Battle 1: Hero defeats Villain
→ Narrative: "Victory was sweet but hollow"

Battle 2: Villain returns stronger
→ Narrative: "The defeated foe rose again, fueled by rage"

Battle 3: Epic rematch
→ Narrative: "Their final confrontation shook the heavens"
```

### Persistent Character Memory

```javascript
characterMemories = {
    "hero_001": {
        battles: [
            { opponent: "villain_001", won: true, close: true },
            { opponent: "villain_002", won: false }
        ],
        emotionalState: "vengeful", // After defeat
        allies: ["hero_002", "hero_003"],
        enemies: ["villain_001", "villain_002"]
    }
}
```

### Dynamic World Events

Combat outcomes affect the world:

```javascript
if (cityDefenderDefeated) {
    recordEvent('city_destroyed', { cityName: 'Genesis City' });
    // Consequences:
    // - Refugees spawn
    // - Economy collapses
    // - New quests unlock
    // - Villain gains power
}
```
