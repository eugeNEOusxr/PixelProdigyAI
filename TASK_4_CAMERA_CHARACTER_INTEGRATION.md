# ðŸŽ® TASK 4 IN PROGRESS: Camera-Character Integration

---

## Overview

This task connects the **input handler**, **player movement system**, and **camera controller** into a single, fully integrated gameplay loop. The result is a playable 3D character that can be controlled with keyboard, mouse, gamepad, or touch, with the camera following and rotating based on player movement and look input.

## Integration Plan

1. **Create integrated test page** (`test_camera_character_integration.html`)
   - Loads all core systems: input, movement, camera, physics
   - Renders a 3D scene with a controllable player and camera
   - UI for mode switching, settings, and stats

2. **Connect Input â†’ Movement â†’ Camera**
   - InputHandler provides movement/look/actions
   - PlayerMovement receives movement and action states
   - CameraController follows player and uses look input

3. **Sync player mesh and camera**
   - Player mesh position/rotation updated by movement system
   - Camera follows player and rotates based on look input

4. **Test all input methods**
   - Keyboard, mouse, gamepad, touch
   - Camera mode toggle (TPS/FPS)
   - All actions (jump, sprint, crouch, etc.)

5. **Display real-time stats and state**
   - Player state, position, camera mode, input sources, active actions
