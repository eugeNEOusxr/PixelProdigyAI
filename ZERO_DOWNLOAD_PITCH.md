## 🚀 THE PITCH

### **Traditional 3D Software:**
```
Blender:    2.9 GB download
Unity:      8+ GB download + install
Unreal:     40+ GB download + install
Maya:       6+ GB download + license
3ds Max:    9+ GB download + subscription

Time to start: 30-60 minutes
Barrier to entry: HIGH
```

### **PixelProdigy:**
```

## 🎯 UPDATED POSITIONING

### **OLD PITCH:**
"3D studio production software"

### **NEW PITCH:**
"The first ZERO-DOWNLOAD 3D production studio. 
No install. No updates. Just click and create."

### **EVEN BETTER:**
"While Blender takes 3GB and Unity takes 8GB to download,
PixelProdigy takes 200KB and runs instantly in your browser.

Professional 3D tools shouldn't require professional IT setup."

- Unreal: 40GB behemoth

This creates massive barriers:
❌ Students can't install on school computers
❌ Cafes/libraries don't allow installations
❌ Poor internet = locked out
❌ IT departments block everything
❌ Updates break workflows
❌ Version hell (which version is everyone on?)"

### **The Solution**

"PixelProdigy: Zero-download 3D production studio

✅ 200KB initial load
✅ Runs instantly in any browser
✅ Works on Chromebooks, tablets, locked-down PCs
✅ Auto-updates (just refresh)
✅ Share work via URL
✅ No IT approval needed"

### **Market Opportunity**

```
Global 3D Software Market: $15.8B (2024)
Web-Based Tools Market: Growing 24% YoY
Target Users:
- Students: 50M+ (locked-down computers)
- Hobbyists: 100M+ (don't want big installs)
- Professionals: 10M+ (need quick access)
- Educators: 5M+ (IT restrictions)
```

### **Competitive Advantage**

| Feature | Blender | Unity | PixelProdigy |
|---------|---------|-------|--------------|
| Download Size | 2.9GB | 8GB | 0 bytes |
| Install Time | 10 min | 30 min | 0 sec |
| Admin Rights | Required | Required | Not needed |
| Works on Chromebook | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Auto-updates | Manual | Manual | Automatic |
| Share via URL | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Mobile Access | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |

### **Revenue Projections**

```
Year 1: 1,000 users × $19/month = $228K ARR
Year 2: 10,000 users × $19/month = $2.28M ARR
Year 3: 50,000 users × $19/month = $11.4M ARR

Education licensing:
50 schools × 100 students × $5/student = $25K
Scales to thousands of schools globally
```

### **The Ask**

"$500K seed round to:
- Build team (2 devs, 1 designer)
- Add collaboration features
- Marketing campaign (target schools, hobbyists)
- Enterprise sales (IT-friendly positioning)

18-month runway to profitability
Path to $10M ARR in 3 years"

Subject: Zero-download 3D studio - $15.8B market disruption

Hi [Name],

Quick question: How long does it take to start using Blender?

Answer: 10+ minutes (2.9GB download + install + setup)

How long does it take to start using PixelProdigy?

Answer: 5 seconds (click URL, start creating)

I've built the first zero-download 3D production studio. 
200KB web app. Runs in any browser. Professional tools.

Market opportunity:
• 3D software market: $15.8B
• Students locked out (can't install on school PCs)
• Hobbyists deterred (don't want 8GB Unity install)
• Teams frustrated (version hell)

PixelProdigy eliminates all barriers:
✅ Works on Chromebooks (students)
✅ Works in cafes (public computers)
✅ Works globally (200KB vs 2.9GB)
✅ Auto-updates (just refresh)
✅ Share via URL (instant collaboration)

Monetization: SaaS ($9-49/month) + Education licensing

Looking for $500K seed to:
- Build team (proven traction: 6 months, production-ready)
- Add collaboration features
- Target schools (IT-friendly = huge advantage)

Path to $10M ARR in 3 years.

Can I send you a 2-minute demo?

Best,
Jeremy
