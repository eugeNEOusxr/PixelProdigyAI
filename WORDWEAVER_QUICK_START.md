# 🚀 WordWeaver Quick Start Guide

**Get your blog posts into 3D in 3 steps!**

---

## 📋 What You Need

✅ Your blog platform: `pixelprodigy_blog.html`  
✅ Your 3D universe: `pixelprodigy3d.html`  
✅ WordWeaver engine: `wordweaver_engine.js` ✨ NEW  
✅ Blog bridge: `wordweaver_blog_bridge.js` ✨ NEW  

---

## 🎯 Step 1: Test the Demo

**Open the standalone demo first:**

```bash
# Open in browser
wordweaver_demo.html
```

**What you'll see:**
- 🧬 Write a blog post in the left panel
- 🧵 Click "Weave into 3D" button
- 👀 Watch your text transform into an anatomical 3D structure!

**Try these keyboard shortcuts:**
- `W` - Weave current post
- `G` - Load sample gallery (3 example posts)
- `C` - Clear all structures

---

## 🔗 Step 2: Connect to Your Blog

**Add this ONE line to `pixelprodigy_blog.html`:**

```html
<!-- Add before closing </body> tag -->
<script src="wordweaver_blog_bridge.js"></script>
```

**What this does:**
- ✅ Adds "🧬 View in 3D Universe" button to every blog post
- ✅ Adds "🌌 3D Gallery" button to navigation bar
- ✅ Enhances post modals with 3D preview option
- ✅ Automatically syncs with pixelprodigy3d.html

---

## 🌌 Step 3: Enable in 3D Universe

**Add these TWO lines to `pixelprodigy3d.html`:**

```html
<!-- Add in <head> section -->
<script src="wordweaver_engine.js"></script>

<!-- Add before closing </body> tag, AFTER Three.js -->
<script src="wordweaver_blog_bridge.js"></script>
```

**What this does:**
- ✅ Loads WordWeaver engine into your 3D universe
- ✅ Automatically detects when coming from blog
- ✅ Converts blog posts into 3D anatomical structures
- ✅ Adds WordWeaver control panel to UI

---

## 🎨 How It Works

### From Blog → 3D

```
User clicks "View in 3D" on blog post
         ↓
Post ID saved to localStorage
         ↓
Navigate to: pixelprodigy3d.html?mode=wordweaver
         ↓
WordWeaver detects mode parameter
         ↓
Loads post from localStorage
         ↓
Transforms text into 3D anatomical structure:
  - Title → Skull vertices
  - Paragraphs → Spine vertebrae
  - Sentences → Rib cage
  - Words → Muscle fibers
  - Tags → Nervous system
  - Sentiment → Skin color/glow
         ↓
Structure appears in 3D universe!
```

### Gallery Mode

```
User clicks "3D Gallery" in blog navigation
         ↓
Navigate to: pixelprodigy3d.html?mode=wordweaver&gallery=all
         ↓
WordWeaver loads ALL blog posts
         ↓
Arranges in circular gallery (8 unit radius)
         ↓
Camera positioned to see full gallery
         ↓
User can fly/walk between post structures!
```

## 📊 Anatomical Mapping Reference

| Blog Element | 3D Anatomy | Visual |
|--------------|------------|--------|
| **Title** | Skull | Each letter = vertex point |
| **Paragraphs** | Spine | Each paragraph = vertebra |
| **Sentences** | Ribs | Each sentence = rib pair |
| **Words** | Muscles | Each word = muscle fiber |
| **Tags** | Nerves | Each tag = nerve pathway |
| **Sentiment** | Skin | Emotion = color/material |
| **Views** | Orbit | More views = larger orbit |

## 🎓 Example: Blog Post Transformation

**Input (2D Blog):**
```
Title: "My Amazing Journey"
Content:
  "This is the introduction to my amazing journey.
   
   The middle section describes all the wonderful experiences.
   
   Finally, this conclusion wraps everything up nicely."
Tags: adventure, learning, growth
Sentiment: Positive (+0.7)
```

**Output (3D Structure):**
```
🧠 SKULL
   └─ 18 vertices (one per letter in title)
   
🦴 SPINE
   ├─ Vertebra 1 (intro paragraph)
   ├─ Vertebra 2 (body paragraph)
   └─ Vertebra 3 (conclusion)
   
🫁 RIB CAGE
   ├─ Rib pair 1 (sentence 1)
   ├─ Rib pair 2 (sentence 2)
   └─ Rib pair 3 (sentence 3)
   
💪 MUSCLES
   └─ 23 muscle fibers (one per word)
   
🧠 NERVOUS SYSTEM
   ├─ Nerve: "adventure"
   ├─ Nerve: "learning"
   └─ Nerve: "growth"
   
🌈 SKIN
   └─ Green glowing envelope (positive sentiment)
```

## 🎮 User Interactions

### In Blog:
- Click "🧬 View in 3D Universe" → See single post in 3D
- Click "🌌 3D Gallery" → See all posts as 3D gallery
- Open post modal → "🧬 View 3D Structure" button appears

### In 3D Universe:
- **Mouse click** on word fiber → Highlights and logs word
- **WASD** → Fly between structures
- **Mouse drag** → Orbit camera around structure
- **Scroll** → Zoom in/out

### WordWeaver UI Panel:
- **👁️ Toggle Layers** → Show/hide skin layer

## 🔧 Advanced Customization

### Change Material Colors

Edit `wordweaver_engine.js` line 30-80:

```javascript
this.materials = {
  positive: new THREE.MeshPhysicalMaterial({
    color: 0x4ade80,  // Change this hex color
    emissive: 0x22c55e,
    // ...
  }),
  // ... other materials
};
```

### Adjust Structure Size

Edit `wordweaver_engine.js`:

```javascript
// Line 235 - Skull radius
const radius = 0.3 + (complexity * 0.2); // Increase 0.3 for bigger skulls

// Line 299 - Vertebra spacing
vertebra.position.y = -(i * vertebraHeight * 1.2); // Increase 1.2 for more spacing

// Line 468 - Gallery radius
const radius = 8; // Change 8 to 10, 15, etc. for wider gallery
```

### Add New Sentiment Categories

Edit `wordweaver_engine.js` line 590:

```javascript
analyzeSentiment(text) {
  const positiveWords = ['love', 'great', 'amazing', /* add more */];
  const negativeWords = ['hate', 'terrible', /* add more */];
  const technicalWords = ['algorithm', 'function', /* add more */];
  // ... rest of function
}
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "No structures appearing in 3D"
- ✅ Check browser console for errors
- ✅ Verify `wordweaver_engine.js` is loaded (check Network tab)
- ✅ Ensure blog posts exist in localStorage: `localStorage.getItem('pixelprodigy_posts')`
- ✅ Check URL has `?mode=wordweaver` parameter

### "Structures look weird/broken"
- ✅ Clear browser cache and refresh
- ✅ Check Three.js version (r128 recommended)
- ✅ Verify blog post has all required fields (title, content, tags)

### "Performance is slow"
- ✅ Reduce number of structures (start with 1-3 posts)
- ✅ Use shorter blog posts for testing
- ✅ Check GPU acceleration is enabled in browser
- ✅ Lower resolution: `renderer.setPixelRatio(1)` instead of `window.devicePixelRatio`

### "Blog posts not saving"
- ✅ Check localStorage isn't full (5-10MB limit)
- ✅ Verify blog posts are being saved: Check Application > Local Storage in DevTools
- ✅ Ensure `pixelprodigy_blog.html` is on same domain as `pixelprodigy3d.html`
