## 🎯 SEL-004: Selection Utilities

### Keyboard Shortcuts

| Key | Function | Description |
|-----|----------|-------------|
| **I** | Invert Selection | Flips selection (selected ↔ unselected) |
| **G** | Grow Selection | Expands to neighboring vertices |
| **H** | Shrink Selection | Contracts inward, removes edges |
| **Escape** | Clear Selection | Deselects all vertices |
| **Ctrl+A** | Select All | Selects every vertex |

### How They Work

#### Invert Selection (I Key)
```
Current: 100 vertices selected out of 500
Press I: Now 400 vertices selected (the opposite)
```
**Use Case:** Selected background, need foreground

#### Grow Selection (G Key)
```
Current: Small area selected
Press G: Selection expands outward to neighbors
Press G again: Expands further
```
**Use Case:** Started too small, need more coverage

#### Shrink Selection (H Key)
```
Current: Large area selected  
Press H: Removes edge vertices, contracts inward
Press H again: Shrinks further to core
```
**Use Case:** Selected too much, need just center

#### Clear Selection (Escape)
```
Current: Vertices selected
Press Escape: All deselected, start fresh
```

#### Select All (Ctrl+A)
```
Press Ctrl+A: Every vertex selected
Useful for: Global modifications, inversions
```
