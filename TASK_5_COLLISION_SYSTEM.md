# ðŸ§± TASK 5 IN PROGRESS: World Collision System

---

## Overview

This task implements a robust collision detection system for the player and world geometry. The system will prevent the player from passing through the ground, walls, and objects, and will handle boundaries and slopes. It will integrate with the existing movement and physics systems.

---

## Collision System Plan

1. **Collision Shapes**
   - Use capsules for player, AABB/OBB for world objects, and planes for ground

2. **Broadphase**
   - Simple spatial partitioning (grid or bounding box checks) for performance

3. **Narrowphase**
   - Capsule-vs-plane, capsule-vs-box, and capsule-vs-sphere checks
   - Slope angle checks for walkable surfaces

4. **Penetration Resolution**
   - Push player out of colliding geometry
   - Slide along walls and slopes

5. **Integration**
   - Hook into player movement update
   - Provide collisionWorld object to movement system

6. **Test Environment**
   - Add obstacles (boxes, walls, slopes) to integration test page
   - Visualize collisions for debugging

## Files To Be Created/Updated

- `world_generation/collision_system.js` (core collision logic)
- Update: `player_movement.js` (integrate collision checks)
- Update: `test_camera_character_integration.html` (add obstacles, visualize collisions)
- `TASK_5_COLLISION_SYSTEM.md` (documentation)

---

## Next Steps

- Implement `collision_system.js` with capsule-vs-world collision
- Integrate with player movement
- Update test page for collision testing
- Document system and mark task complete
