# Trailer Park Recovery Community Model

## üèòÔ∏è The Vision: Buy, Secure, Transform, Graduate

**Concept**: Purchase existing trailer parks in distressed areas, implement strict HOA-style rules, provide security, create structured living environment, offer PixelProdigy AI training + MPT income, graduate residents into independent housing.

**Why This Works**:
- ‚úÖ **Cost-Effective**: $2-5M buys entire 50-100 unit park vs $20M+ for new construction
- ‚úÖ **Immediate Capacity**: Housing exists, just needs management
- ‚úÖ **Community Model**: Shared spaces, peer support, collective accountability
- ‚úÖ **Revenue Generating**: Residents pay subsidized rent (30-50% of earnings)
- ‚úÖ **Scalable**: Buy 10 parks = 500-1,000 people housed
- ‚úÖ **Real Assets**: Property appreciates as neighborhood improves
