## 📖 CONCEPT OVERVIEW

PixelProdigy Blog is a **creative ecosystem** for writers, thinkers, and creators who want to build both a personal archive and a public presence. It's not just another blogging platform — it's a smarter space for self-expression and digital connection.

### Core Philosophy

> **"In a digital world where everyone is trying to be seen, PixelProdigy removes the barrier between private journaling and public publishing."**

Every user can create **two types of posts:**
