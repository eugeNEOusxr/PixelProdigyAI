## 📂 Workspace Organization

The workspace organizes files into categories:

| Folder | What's Inside |
|--------|---------------|
| 📱 **Mobile Root** | All files (main view) |
| 📚 **Documentation** | All .md files (docs, guides, references) |
| 🎨 **HTML Apps** | All .html files (applications) |
| ⚙️ **Scripts** | Build and deployment scripts |
| 🏗️ **Core Files** | package.json, tsconfig.json, server.ts, JS files |

**Why?** On mobile screens, having focused folder views reduces clutter and makes navigation faster.
